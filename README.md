# code-tests

- This repository is for sharing "Take Home" styled code tests among SDG Alums.
- Challenges can take 24 hours up to 4 days to complete.

## Taking Tests

1. Create a new project
2. Commit your project to GitHub
3. Submit your GitHub link to #feedback-requests on the SDG Student/Alumni Slack channel for review

## Reviewing Tests

## Contributing Tests

**Note:** You can use code test that you have taken as inspiration but please do NOT submit an exact copy of a code test you have taken when interviewing for a position.

In general, we follow this workflow:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Clone the project to your own machine.
3. Create a folder under one of the categories
4. Create a README file that describes what needs to be done to complete the test (See Standard Formatting for Challenges)
5. Commit changes to your own branch.
6. Push your work back up to your fork.
7. Submit a Pull Request so that we can review your changes.

- **NOTE**: Be sure to merge the latest from upstream before making a Pull Request.
